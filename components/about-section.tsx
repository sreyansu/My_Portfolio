              <p>
                Hailing from Bhadrak, Odisha, my journey into the world of technology has been a blend of relentless curiosity and a passion for creating meaningful digital experiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                üéì I‚Äôm currently pursuing Computer Science and Engineering at VEER SURENDRA SAI UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (VSSUT), Sambalpur. My time here has shaped my technical foundation while encouraging me to innovate and collaborate beyond the classroom.
              </p>
              <p>
                üíª As a Web Developer at the Aerotech Club, I‚Äôve contributed to building and maintaining digital platforms that support club operations and outreach, gaining hands-on experience in full-stack web technologies.
üå§Ô∏è One of my standout projects is Weathora, a modern weather web app with a futuristic UI that adapts to real-time conditions. It integrates weather data, air quality index, and carbon footprint metrics‚Äîreflecting my commitment to blending design with environmental consciousness.
üíº I further honed my skills during a Web Developer Internship at Skill Dunia, Hyderabad, where I worked on real-world web development tasks, focusing on clean code, responsive interfaces, and user-centric design.
              </p>
              <p>
                üîó Whether it‚Äôs crafting intuitive interfaces or exploring new tech stacks, I‚Äôm driven by the desire to build solutions that are not only functional but also meaningful.
